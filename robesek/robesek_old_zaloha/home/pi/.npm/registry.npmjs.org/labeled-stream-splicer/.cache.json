labeled-stream-splicer\n\n[stream splicer](https://npmjs.org/package/stream-splicer) with labels\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/labeled-stream-splicer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/labeled-stream-splicer)\n\n# example\n\nHere's an example that exposes a label for `deps` and `pack`:\n\n``` js\nvar splicer = require('labeled-stream-splicer');\nvar through = require('through2');\nvar deps = require('module-deps');\nvar pack = require('browser-pack');\nvar lstream = require('lstream');\n\nvar pipeline = splicer.obj([\n    'deps', [ deps() ],\n    'pack', [ pack({ raw: true }) ]\n]);\n\npipeline.get('deps').unshift(lstream());\n\npipeline.get('deps').push(through.obj(function (row, enc, next) {\n    row.source = row.source.toUpperCase();\n    this.push(row);\n    next();\n}));\n\nprocess.stdin.pipe(pipeline).pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nHere the `deps` sub-pipeline is augmented with a post-transformation that\nuppercases its source input.\n\n# methods\n\n``` js\nvar splicer = require('labeled-stream-splicer')\n```\n\nThe API is the same as\n[stream-splicer](https://npmjs.org/package/stream-splicer),\nexcept that `pipeline.get()`, `pipeline.splice()`, and `pipeline.indexOf()` can\naccept string labels in addition to numeric indexes.\n\n## var pipeline = splicer(streams, opts)\n\nCreate a `pipeline` duplex stream given an array of `streams`. Each `stream`\nwill be piped to the next. Writes to `pipeline` get written to the first stream\nand data for reads from `pipeline` come from the last stream.\n\nTo signify a label, a stream may have a `.label` property or a string may be\nplaced in the `streams` array.\n\nFor example, for streams `[ a, 'foo', b, c, 'bar', d ]`, this pipeline is\nconstructed internally:\n\n```\na.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d)\n```\n\nwith a label `'foo`' that points to `b` and a label `'bar'` that points to `d`.\nIf `a` or `c` has a `.label` property, that label would be used for addressing.\n\nInput will get written into `a`. Output will be read from `d`.\n\nIf any of the elements in `streams` are arrays, they will be converted into\nnested labeled pipelines. This is useful if you want to expose a hookable\npipeline with grouped insertion points.\n\n## var pipeline = splicer.obj(streams, opts)\n\nCreate a `pipeline` with `opts.objectMode` set to true for convenience.\n\n## var removed = pipeline.splice(index, howMany, stream, ...)\n\nSplice the pipeline starting at `index`, removing `howMany` streams and\nreplacing them with each additional `stream` argument provided.\n\nThe streams that were removed from the splice and returned.\n\n`index` can be an integer index or a label.\n\n## pipeline.push(stream, ...)\n\nPush one or more streams to the end of the pipeline.\n\nThe stream arguments may have a `label` property that will be used for string\nlookups.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.pop()\n\nPop a stream from the end of the pipeline.\n\n## pipeline.unshift(stream, ...)\n\nUnshift one or more streams to the begining of the pipeline.\n\nThe stream arguments may have a `label` property that will be used for string\nlookups.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.shift()\n\nShift a stream from the begining of the pipeline.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.get(index)\n\nReturn the stream at index `index`.\n\n`index` can be an integer or a string label.\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install labeled-stream-splicer\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-12-30T04:13:15.761Z","created":"2014-06-11T05:30:11.011Z","1.0.0":"2014-06-11T05:30:11.011Z","1.0.1":"2014-11-18T03:23:39.464Z","1.0.2":"2014-11-18T05:05:43.452Z","2.0.0":"2015-08-24T05:06:13.314Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/substack/labeled-stream-splicer","keywords":["splice","stream","labels","mutable","pipeline"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/substack/labeled-stream-splicer.git"},"author":{"name":"James Halliday","email":"mail@substack.net","url":"http://substack.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/substack/labeled-stream-splicer/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.markdown","users":{"dexteryy":true,"wenbing":true,"simplyianm":true,"s4g6":true,"seangenabe":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5865dedb-27fe\""}
