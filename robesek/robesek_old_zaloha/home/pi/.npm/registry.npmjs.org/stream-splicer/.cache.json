stream-splicer\n\nstreaming pipeline with a mutable configuration\n\nThis module is similar to\n[stream-combiner](https://npmjs.org/package/stream-combiner),\nbut with a pipeline configuration that can be changed at runtime.\n\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/substack/stream-splicer.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/stream-splicer)\n\n# example\n\nThis example begins with an HTTP header parser that waits for an empty line to\nsignify the end of the header. At that point, it switches to a streaming json\nparser to operate on the HTTP body.\n\n``` js\nvar splicer = require('stream-splicer');\nvar through = require('through2');\nvar JSONStream = require('JSONStream');\nvar split = require('split');\n\nvar headerData = {};\nvar headers = through.obj(function (buf, enc, next) {\n    var line = buf.toString('utf8');\n    if (line === '') {\n        this.push(headerData);\n        pipeline.splice(1, 1, JSONStream.parse([ 'rows', true ]));\n    }\n    else {\n        var m = /^(\\S+):(.+)/.exec(line);\n        var key = m && m[1].trim();\n        var value = m && m[2].trim();\n        if (m) headerData[key] = value;\n    }\n    next();\n});\nvar pipeline = splicer([ split(), headers, JSONStream.stringify() ]);\nprocess.stdin.pipe(pipeline).pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nintput:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: substack.net\nUser-Agent: echo\n\n{\"rows\":[\"beep\",\"boop\"]}\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```\n$ echo -ne 'GET / HTTP/1.1\\nHost: substack.net\\nUser-Agent: echo\\n\\n{\"rows\":[\"beep\",\"boop\"]}\\n' | node example/header.js\n[\n{\"Host\":\"substack.net\",\"User-Agent\":\"echo\"}\n,\n\"beep\"\n,\n\"boop\"\n]\n```\n\n# methods\n\n``` js\nvar splicer = require('stream-splicer')\n```\n\n## var pipeline = splicer(streams, opts)\n\nCreate a `pipeline` duplex stream given an array of `streams`. Each `stream`\nwill be piped to the next. Writes to `pipeline` get written to the first stream\nand data for reads from `pipeline` come from the last stream.\n\nFor example, for streams `[ a, b, c, d ]`, this pipeline is constructed\ninternally:\n\n```\na.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d)\n```\n\nInput will get written into `a`. Output will be read from `d`.\n\nIf any of the elements in `streams` are arrays, they will be converted into\nnested pipelines. This is useful if you want to expose a hookable pipeline with\ngrouped insertion points.\n\n## var pipeline = splicer.obj(streams, opts)\n\nCreate a `pipeline` with `opts.objectMode` set to true for convenience.\n\n## var removed = pipeline.splice(index, howMany, stream, ...)\n\nSplice the pipeline starting at `index`, removing `howMany` streams and\nreplacing them with each additional `stream` argument provided.\n\nThe streams that were removed from the splice and returned.\n\n## pipeline.push(stream, ...)\n\nPush one or more streams to the end of the pipeline.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.pop()\n\nPop a stream from the end of the pipeline.\n\n## pipeline.unshift(stream, ...)\n\nUnshift one or more streams to the begining of the pipeline.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.shift()\n\nShift a stream from the begining of the pipeline.\n\n## var stream = pipeline.get(index, ...)\n\nReturn the stream at index `index, ...`. Indexes can be negative.\n\nMultiple indexes will traverse into nested pipelines.\n\n# attributes\n\n## pipeline.length\n\nThe number of streams in the pipeline\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install stream-splicer\n```\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"substack","email":"mail@substack.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-08-24T05:01:33.167Z","created":"2014-06-09T21:22:38.801Z","1.0.0":"2014-06-09T21:22:38.801Z","1.0.1":"2014-06-09T23:26:01.238Z","1.0.2":"2014-06-10T00:03:00.512Z","1.1.0":"2014-06-10T02:38:34.562Z","1.1.1":"2014-06-12T23:39:05.625Z","1.1.2":"2014-06-13T01:14:26.470Z","1.2.0":"2014-06-15T05:37:25.053Z","1.3.0":"2014-06-16T04:45:41.126Z","1.3.1":"2014-09-27T10:10:16.420Z","1.3.2":"2015-06-25T19:09:36.254Z","2.0.0":"2015-08-24T05:01:33.167Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/substack/stream-splicer","keywords":["stream","mutable","pipeline"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/substack/stream-splicer.git"},"author":{"name":"James Halliday","email":"mail@substack.net","url":"http://substack.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/substack/stream-splicer/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.markdown","users":{"dexteryy":true,"kael":true,"wenbing":true,"ryanj":true,"alanshaw":true,"edin-m":true,"s4g6":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"55daa52d-502c\""}
